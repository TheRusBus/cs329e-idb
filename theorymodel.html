		<td>The branch of mathematics that deals with limits and the differentiation and integration of functions of one or more variables.</td>
		<td>Mid 17th Century</td>
		<td>With calculus, we have the ability to find the effects of changing conditions on a system. By studying these, you can learn how to control a system to make it do what you want it to do.</td>

		<td>Einstein's general relativity theory says that gravity curves space and time, resulting in a tendency for the orbiting clocks to tick slightly faster, by about 45 microseconds per day. Without the proper application of relativity, GPS would fail in its navigational functions within about 2 minutes.</td>
