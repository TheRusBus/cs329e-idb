			Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an 
			effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, 
			galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. 
			More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy.

	<h3>History</h3>

	<div>
		<h5></h5>
		<p>
		     In early times, astronomy only comprised the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some 
		     locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial 
		     uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops, as well as 
		     in understanding the length of the year.
		</p>
		<p>
             Before tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations 
             developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were 
             assembled, and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the 
             positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions 
             of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth 
             was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric 
             model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.
        </p>
        <p>
			During the Renaissance, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a <a href="./theoryHelio.html">heliocentric model</a> of the solar system. His work was defended, expanded upon, 
			and corrected by <a href="ScientistGalileo.html">Galileo Galilei</a> and Johannes Kepler. Galileo used telescopes to enhance his observations. Kepler was the first to devise
			 a system that described correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed 
			 in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of 
			 gravitation to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.
        </p>
        <p>
			During the 18–19th centuries, the study of the three body problem by Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert led to more accurate predictions 
			about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Lagrange and Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and 
			moons to be estimated from their perturbations.
			
			Significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. 
			Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of 
			different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of temperatures, masses, and sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
			The existence of the Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way, as a separate group of stars, was only proved in the 20th century, along with the 
			existence of "external" galaxies. The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe.
			Theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as black holes and neutron stars, which have be used to explain 
			such observed phenomena such as quasars, pulsars, blazars, and radio galaxies. Physical cosmology made huge advances during the 20th 
			century, with the model of the Big Bang, which is heavily supported by evidence provided by cosmic microwave background radiation, 
			Hubble's law, and the cosmological abundances of elements. Space telescopes have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic 
			spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere. Recently, in February 2016, it was revealed that the LIGO project had detected 
			evidence of gravitational waves, in September 2015.

	<h3>Subfields</h3>
	<div>
	<h5>Planetary Science</h5>
	<p>
		Planetary science is the study of the assemblage of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as 
		well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. 
		This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system, although many new discoveries are 
		still being made.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Stellar Astronomy</h5>
	<p>
		The study of stars and stellar evolution is fundamental to our understanding of the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined 
		through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions 
		of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a 
		protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Cosmology</h5>
	<p>
		Cosmology could be considered the study of the Universe as a whole. Observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe, a branch known as 
		physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the 
		well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8 
		billion years to its present condition. The concept of the big bang can be traced back to the discovery of the microwave background 
		radiation in 1965.

	<h3>Impacts/Applications</h3>
	<div>
	<p>
		Advances in astronomy have led to the development of many new technologies, such as wireless local area network (WLAN), x-ray scanning technology,
		 and gamma ray spectrometers. Some of the most useful examples of technology transfer between astronomy and industry include advances in imaging 
		 and communications. For example, a film called Kodak Technical Pan is used extensively by medical and industrial spectroscopists, 
		 industrial photographers, and artists, and was originally created so that solar astronomers could record the changes in the surface 
		 structure of the Sun. In addition, the development of Technical Pan — again driven by the requirements of astronomers — was used for 
		 several decades (until it was discontinued) to detect diseased crops and forests, in dentistry and medical diagnosis, and for probing 
		 layers of paintings to reveal forgeries (National Research Council, 1991). Since the development of space-based telescopes, information acquisition for 
		 defence has shifted from using ground-based to aerial and space-based, techniques. Defence satellites are essentially telescopes pointed
		  towards Earth and require identical technology and hardware to those used in their astronomical counterparts. In addition, processing 
		  satellite images uses the same software and processes as astronomical images.
