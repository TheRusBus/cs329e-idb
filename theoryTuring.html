			The Turing test is a test, developed by <a href="./ScientistAlanTuring.html" >Alan Turing</a> in 1950, of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.
			Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine that is designed to generate human-like responses.
			The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another.
			The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so that the result would not be dependent on the machine's ability to render words as speech.
			If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human (Turing originally suggested that the machine would convince a human 30% of the time after five minutes of conversation), the machine is said to have passed the test.
			The test does not check the ability to give correct answers to questions, only how closely answers resemble those a human would give.
            The test was introduced by Turing in his paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", while working at the University of Manchester (Turing, 1950; p. 460).
			It opens with the words: "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'" Because "thinking" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to "replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."
			Turing's new question is: "Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?" This question, Turing believed, is one that can actually be answered.
			In the remainder of the paper, he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that "machines can think".

	    <h3> Standard Interpretation </h3>
	    <p>
		    Common understanding has it that the purpose of the Turing Test is not specifically to determine whether a computer is able to fool an interrogator into believing that it is a human, but rather whether a computer could imitate a human.
			While there is some dispute whether this interpretation was intended by Turing; Sterrett believes that it was and thus conflates the second version with this one, while others, such as Traiger, do not – this has nevertheless led to what can be viewed as the "standard interpretation."
			In this version, player A is a computer and player B a person of either sex. The role of the interrogator is not to determine which is male and which is female, but which is a computer and which is a human.
			The fundamental issue with the standard interpretation is that the interrogator cannot differentiate which responder is human, and which is machine.
			There are issues about duration, but the standard interpretation generally considers this limitation as something that should be reasonable.

	    <h3> Prediction </h3>
		<p>
		    Turing predicted that machines would eventually be able to pass the test; in fact, he estimated that by the year 2000, machines with around 100 MB of storage would be able to fool 30% of human judges in a five-minute test, and that people would no longer consider the phrase "thinking machine" contradictory.
			(In practice, from 2009–2012, the Loebner Prize chatterbot contestants only managed to fool a judge once, and that was only due to the human contestant pretending to be a chatbot.)
			He further predicted that machine learning would be an important part of building powerful machines, a claim considered plausible by contemporary researchers in artificial intelligence.
