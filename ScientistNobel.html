<h3>

	<h3>
	Relation to Dynamite
	</h3>
	<p>
	Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel and was the first safely
manageable explosive stronger than black powder. Nobel obtained
patents for his invention in England on 7 May 1867, in Sweden on
19 October 1867. After its introduction, dynamite rapidly gained
wide-scale use as a safe alternative to black powder and
nitroglycerin. Nobel tightly controlled the patents, and
unlicensed duplicating companies were quickly shut down.
However, a few American businessmen got around the patent by
using a slightly different formula.
