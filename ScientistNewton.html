	Overview
	</h3>
	<p>
	Sir Isaac Newton, (born December 25, 1642 [January 4, 1643, New
Style], Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England died March 20 [March
31], 1727, London), English physicist and mathematician, who was
the culminating figure of the scientific revolution of the 17th
century. In optics, his discovery of the composition of white
light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of
light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics. In
mechanics, his three laws of motion, the basic principles of
modern <a href = "./fieldPhysics.html">physics</a>, resulted in the formulation of the law of
universal gravitation. In <a href = "./fieldMathematics.html">mathematics</a>, he was the original
discoverer of the infinitesimal <a href = "./Calculus.html">calculus</a>. Newton's Philosophiae
Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of
Natural Philosophy, 1687) was one of the most important single
works in the history of modern science.

	Relation to Calculus
	</h3>
	<p>
	Over two miraculous years, during the time of the Great Plague
of 1665-6, the young Newton developed a new theory of light,
discovered and quantified gravitation, and pioneered a
revolutionary new approach to mathematics: infinitesimal
calculus. His theory of calculus built on earlier work by his
fellow Englishmen John Wallis and Isaac Barrow, as well as on
work of such Continental mathematicians as Rene Descartes,
Pierre de Fermat, Bonaventura Cavalieri, Johann van Waveren
Hudde and Gilles Personne de Roberval. Unlike the static
geometry of the Greeks, calculus allowed mathematicians and
engineers to make sense of the motion and dynamic change in the
changing world around us, such as the orbits of planets, the
motion of fluids, etc.

<p>
Newton completed no definitive publication formalizing his
fluxional calculus; rather, many of his mathematical discoveries
were transmitted through correspondence, smaller papers or as
embedded aspects in his other definitive compilations, such as
the Principia and Opticks.
</p>
<p>
Newton had begun to realize the central property of inversion.
He had created an expression for the area under a curve by
considering a momentary increase at a point. In effect, the
fundamental theorem of calculus was built into his calculations.
While his new formulation offered incredible potential, Newton
was well aware of its logical limitations at the time. He admits
that “errors are not to be disregarded in mathematics, no matter
how small” and that what he had achieved was “shortly explained
rather than accurately demonstrated.”
