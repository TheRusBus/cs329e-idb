			Mathematics is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among 
			mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. Mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to 
			formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical 
			structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the 
			use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and 
			motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research 
			required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

	<h3>History</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many 
			animals, was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) 
			have something in common, namely quantity of their members.
		</p>
		<p>
			As evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also 
			recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time – days, seasons, years. Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear 
			until around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial 
			calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy. The earliest uses of mathematics were in trading, land measurement, 
			painting and weaving patterns and the recording of time. In Babylonian mathematics elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, 
			multiplication and division) first appears in the archaeological record. Numeracy pre-dated writing and numeral systems have been many 
			and diverse, with the first known written numerals created by Egyptians in Middle Kingdom texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.
			Between 600 and 300 BC the Ancient Greeks began a systematic study of mathematics in its own right with Greek mathematics.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the Golden Age of Islam, especially during the 9th and 10th centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on 
			Greek mathematics: most of them include the contributions from Persian mathematicians such as Al-Khwarismi, Omar Khayyam and 
			Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit 
			of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the Bulletin 
			of the American Mathematical Society, "The number of papers and books included in the Mathematical Reviews database since 1940 (the 
			first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. The 
			overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs."

	<h3>Subfields</h3>
	<div>
	<h4>Pure Mathematics<h4/>
	<h5>Quantity</h5>
	<p>
	The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, 
	which are characterized in arithmetic. The deeper properties of integers are studied in number theory, from which come such popular results as 
	Fermat's Last Theorem. The twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture are two unsolved problems in number theory.
    </p>
    <p>
    As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational numbers ("fractions"). These, in turn, are 
    contained within the real numbers, which are used to represent continuous quantities. Real numbers are generalized to complex numbers. These are 
    the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quaternions and octonions. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to 
    the transfinite numbers, which formalize the concept of "infinity". According to the fundamental theorem of algebra all solutions of equations 
    in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is 
    described with the cardinal numbers. These include the aleph numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Structure</h5>
	<p>
	Many mathematical objects, such as sets of numbers and functions, exhibit internal structure as a consequence of operations or relations that 
	are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number 
	theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that 
	different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state 
	axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups, 
	rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of 
	abstract algebra.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Space</h5>
	<p>
	The study of space originates with geometry – in particular, Euclidean geometry, which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known 
	Pythagorean theorem. Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and 
	with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, non-Euclidean 
	geometries (which play a central role in general relativity) and topology. Quantity and space both play a role in analytic geometry, differential 
	geometry, and algebraic geometry. Convex and discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and functional analysis but now 
	are pursued with an eye on applications in optimization and computer science. Within differential geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and 
	calculus on manifolds, in particular, vector and tensor calculus. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution 
	sets of polynomial equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of topological groups, which combine structure 
	and space. Lie groups are used to study space, structure, and change. Topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth 
	area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes point-set topology, set-theoretic topology, algebraic topology and differential topology. In 
	particular, instances of modern-day topology are metrizability theory, axiomatic set theory, homotopy theory, and Morse theory. Topology also 
	includes the now solved Poincaré conjecture, and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge conjecture. Other results in geometry and topology, 
	including the four color theorem and Kepler conjecture, have been proved only with the help of computers.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Change</h5>
	<p>
	Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the natural sciences, and <a href = "./theoryCalculus.html">calculus</a> was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. 
	Functions arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable 
	is known as real analysis, with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex numbers. Functional analysis focuses attention on 
	(typically infinite-dimensional) spaces of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics. Many problems lead 
	naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as differential equations. Many phenomena in nature 
	can be described by dynamical systems; chaos theory makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still 
	deterministic behavior.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Applied Mathematics</h5>
	<p>
	Applied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, 
	"applied mathematics" is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge. The term applied mathematics also describes the professional 
	specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, applied mathematics focuses on 
	the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure 
    mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with 
    research in pure mathematics.

	<h3>Impacts/Applications</h3>
	<div>
	<p>
		Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance and the social sciences. Applied 
		mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians also engage in pure 
		mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind. There is no clear line separating pure and applied 
		mathematics, and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.
