			Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, 
			evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and 
			subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern 
			all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of 
			life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is 
			also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment 
			to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis.

	<h3>History</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
		Although modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. 
		Natural philosophy was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China. However, the 
		origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece. While the formal study 
		of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the 
		development of biology. Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more 
		empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a 
		series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the Middle Ages.

		Biology began to quickly develop and grow with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvement of the microscope. It was then that scholars 
		discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in 
		entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining. Advances in microscopy also had a profound 
		impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. Then, in 
		1838, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual 
		cells have all the characteristics of life, although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. 
		Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be 
		known as cell theory.

		Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world 
		in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species. Georges-Louis 
		Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common 
		descent. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought; his work influenced the 
		evolutionary theories of both Lamarck and Darwin.
        </p>
        <p>
        Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who was the first to present a coherent theory of <a href = "./theoryEvolution.html">evolution</a>. 
        He posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals, meaning that the more frequently and rigorously 
        an organ was used, the more complex and efficient it would become, thus adapting the animal to its environment. Lamarck believed that these 
        acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal's offspring, who would further develop and perfect them. However, it was the British 
        naturalist <a href = "./ScientistDarwin.html">Charles Darwin</a>, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Malthus's writings on 
        population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, who forged a more successful evolutionary theory 
        based on natural selection; similar reasoning and evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions. Although 
        it was the subject of controversy (which continues to this day), Darwin's theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon 
        became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology.

		The discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics. In the 1940s and 
		early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A 
		focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, 
		marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular 
		domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to 
		contain codons. Finally, the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome. This project was 
		essentially completed in 2003, with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized 
		effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other 
		organisms.

	<h3>Subfields</h3>
	<div>
	<p>
	Sub-disciplines of biology are defined by the scale at which organisms are studied, the kinds of organisms studied, and the methods used to 
	study them: biochemistry examines the rudimentary chemistry of life; molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological 
	molecules; botany studies the biology of plants; cellular biology examines the basic building-block of all life, the cell; physiology examines 
	the physical and chemical functions of tissues, organs, and organ systems of an organism; evolutionary biology examines the processes that 
	produced the diversity of life; and ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment.

	<h3>Impacts/Applications</h3>
	<div>
	<p>
		Improvements in the understanding of biology have greatly improved medical techniques. Doctors are better able to diagnose and treat diseases
		thanks to the understanding of life processes that biology provides. The understanding of microbes that biology gives has also helped improve
		sanitation and has dramatically decreased the rate of microbial infections. Ideas from botany and ecology are used to improve agriculture and help
		provide food to the world's population. Genetics has also helped scientists understand the origin of certain inherited diseases and has allowed
		for the creation of genetically modified plants that can produce more food and have better survivablity. Ecology has also helped people understand
		the importance of a healthy environment and our effect on it.
