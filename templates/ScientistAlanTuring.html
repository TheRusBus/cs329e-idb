<h3>
	Overview
	</h3>
	<p>
	Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing (born June 23, 1912,
London, England?died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British
mathematician and logician, who made major contributions to
mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical
biology and also to the new areas later named <a href="fieldComputerScience.html">computer science</a>,
cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life.

	<p>
	Researchers in the United Kingdom had been exploring "machine
intelligence" for up to ten years prior to the founding of the
field of artificial intelligence (AI) research in 1956. It was a
common topic among the members of the Ratio Club, who were an
informal group of British cybernetics and electronics
researchers that included Alan Turing, after whom the test is
named. Turing, in particular, had been tackling the notion of
machine intelligence since at least 1941 and one of the
earliest-known mentions of "computer intelligence" was made by
him in 1947. In Turing's report, "Intelligent Machinery", he
investigated "the question of whether or not it is possible for
machinery to show intelligent behaviour" and, as part of that
investigation, proposed what may be considered the forerunner to
his later tests: It is not difficult to devise a paper machine
which will play a not very bad game of chess. Now get three men
as subjects for the experiment. A, B and C. A and C are to be
rather poor chess players, B is the operator who works the paper
machine. ... Two rooms are used with some arrangement for
communicating moves, and a game is played between C and either A
or the paper machine. C may find it quite difficult to tell
which he is playing.

	<p>
	"Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950) was the first
published paper by Turing to focus exclusively on machine
intelligence. Turing begins the 1950 paper with the claim, "I
propose to consider the question 'Can machines think?'" As he
highlights, the traditional approach to such a question is to
start with definitions, defining both the terms "machine" and
"intelligence". Turing chooses not to do so; instead he replaces
the question with a new one, "which is closely related to it and
is expressed in relatively unambiguous words." In essence he
proposes to change the question from "Can machines think?" to
"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?" The
advantage of the new question, Turing argues, is that it draws
"a fairly sharp line between the physical and intellectual
capacities of a man."
