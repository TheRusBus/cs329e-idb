			Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes 
			topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of 
			substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through 
			chemical reactions to form different substances.

	<h3>History</h3>

	<div>
		<h5></h5>
		<p>
		     Early civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Babylonians, Indians amassed practical knowledge concerning the arts of metallurgy, pottery 
		     and dyes, but didn't develop a systematic theory. A basic chemical hypothesis first emerged in Classical Greece with the theory of four 
		     elements as propounded definitively by Aristotle stating that fire, air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which 
		     everything is formed as a combination. Greek atomism dates back to 440 BC, arising in works by philosophers such as Democritus and 
		     Epicurus. In 50 BC, the Roman philosopher Lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book De rerum natura (On The Nature of Things).
		      Unlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical observations 
		      and no concern for chemical experiments. In the Hellenistic world the art of alchemy first proliferated, mingling magic and occultism 
		      into the study of natural substances with the ultimate goal of transmuting elements into gold and discovering the elixir of eternal 
		      life.

             The development of the modern scientific method was slow and arduous, but an early scientific method for chemistry began emerging among 
             early Muslim chemists, beginning with the 9th century Persian or Arabian chemist Jābir ibn Hayyān (known as "Geber" in Europe), who is 
             sometimes referred to as "the father of chemistry". He introduced a systematic and experimental approach to scientific research based in 
             the laboratory, in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were largely allegorical and often unintelligble. 
             Under the influence of the new empirical methods propounded by Sir Francis Bacon and others, a group of chemists at Oxford, Robert Boyle, 
             Robert Hooke and John Mayow began to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific discipline. Boyle in particular is regarded 
             as the founding father of chemistry due to his most important work, the classic chemistry text The Sceptical Chymist where the 
             differentiation is made between the claims of alchemy and the empirical scientific discoveries of the new chemistry. He formulated Boyle's 
             law, rejected the classical "four elements" and proposed a mechanistic alternative of atoms and chemical reactions that could be subject 
             to rigorous experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
			English scientist John Dalton proposed the modern theory of atoms; that all substances are composed of indivisible 'atoms' of matter and 
			that different atoms have varying atomic weights. The development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the 
			early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, J. J. Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the 
			prior invention of the voltaic pile by Alessandro Volta. Davy discovered nine new elements including the alkali metals by extracting 
			them from their oxides with electric current.
        </p>
        <p>
			British William Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact 
			multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. J. A. R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the 
			modern periodic table of elements in the 1860s by Dmitri Mendeleev and independently by several other scientists including Julius 
			Lothar Meyer. The inert gases, later called the noble gases were discovered by William Ramsay in collaboration with Lord 
			Rayleigh at the end of the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.
        </p>
        <p>
			At the turn of the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings of chemistry were finally understood due to a series of remarkable 
			discoveries that succeeded in probing and discovering the very nature of the internal structure of atoms. In 1897, J. J. Thomson of 
			Cambridge University discovered the electron and soon after the French scientist Becquerel as well as the couple Pierre and Marie Curie 
			investigated the phenomenon of radioactivity. In a series of pioneering scattering experiments Ernest Rutherford at the University of 
			Manchester discovered the internal structure of the atom and the existence of the proton, classified and explained the different types 
			of radioactivity and successfully transmuted the first element by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles.

	<h3>Subfields</h3>
	<div>
	<h5>Biochemistry</h5>
	<p>
		Biochemistry, sometimes called biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. By 
		controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism, biochemical processes give 
		rise to the complexity of life. Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living 
		processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine to genetics are engaged in biochemical research. Today, 
		the main focus of pure biochemistry is on understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells,
		 which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues, organs, and whole organisms—that is, all of biology.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Organic Chemistry</h5>
	<p>
		Organic chemistry is a chemistry subdiscipline involving the scientific study of the structure, properties, and reactions of organic 
		compounds and organic materials, i.e., matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms. Study of structure includes many physical and 
		chemical methods to determine the chemical composition and the chemical constitution of organic compounds and materials. Study of properties 
		includes both physical properties and chemical properties, and uses similar methods as well as methods to evaluate chemical reactivity, with 
		the aim to understand the behavior of the organic matter in its pure form (when possible), but also in solutions, mixtures, and fabricated 
		forms. The study of organic reactions includes probing their scope through use in preparation of target compounds (e.g., natural products, 
		drugs, polymers, etc.) by chemical synthesis, as well as the focused study of the reactivities of individual organic molecules, both in the 
		laboratory and via theoretical (in silico) study.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Inorganic Chemistry</h5>
	<p>
		Inorganic chemistry deals with the synthesis and behavior of inorganic and organometallic compounds. This field covers all chemical 
		compounds except the myriad organic compounds (carbon based compounds, usually containing C-H bonds), which are the subjects of organic 
		chemistry. The distinction between the two disciplines is far from absolute, as there is much overlap in the subdiscipline of organometallic 
		chemistry. It has applications in every aspect of the chemical industry, including catalysis, materials science, pigments, surfactants, 
		coatings, medications, fuels, and agriculture.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Physical Chemistry</h5>
	<p>
		Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of the principles, 
		practices and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, analytical 
		dynamics and chemical equilibrium. Physical chemistry, in contrast to chemical physics, is predominantly (but not always) a macroscopic or 
		supra-molecular science, as the majority of the principles on which it was founded relate to the bulk rather than the molecular/atomic 
		structure alone (for example, chemical equilibrium and colloids).

	<h3>Impacts/Applications</h3>
	<div>
	<p>
		Chemistry is used widely in medicine to help create new drugs and to understand the processes of life on the molecular level. Chemistry
		is also used in agriculture to develop new pesticides and fertilizers. Chemistry is also used to develop new materials and chemicals for use
		in engineering and almost every conceivable industry.
