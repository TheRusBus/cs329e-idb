	<h1>Physics</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			Physics is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior
			 through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the
			  most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the 
			  universe behaves.

	<h3>History</h3>
	<div>
		<h5>Natural Philosophy</h5>
		<p>
			Natural philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic period, (650 BCE – 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic philosophers
			 like Thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.
			  They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment;for example, 
			  atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was first proposed by Leucippus and his pupil Democritus.
		</p>
		<h5>Classical Physics</h5>
		<p>
			Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now
			 considered to be the laws of physics. Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the 
			 solar system with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies determined by Johannes 
			 Kepler between 1609 and 1619, pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy by Galileo Galilei in the 16th and 17th 
			 Centuries, and Isaac Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation that would come to bear his 
			 name. Newton also developed calculus, the mathematical study of change, which provided new mathematical methods for solving 
			 physical problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			The discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and electromagnetics resulted from greater research efforts during the Industrial
		    Revolution as energy needs increased. The laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling
		    at non-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation in such situations, and theories such as quantum mechanics and the
		    theory of relativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales. However, inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small
		    objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century.
		</p>
		<h5>Modern Physics</h5>		
		<p>
			Modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in quantum theory and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.
			 Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations. Classical mechanics predicted a
			  varying speed of light, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism; 
			  this discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of special relativity, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies 
			  and allowed for a constant speed of light. Black body radiation provided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected 
			  when Planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency; 
			  this, along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, led to the 
			  theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small scales.
		</p>
		<p>
			Quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac. From this early work, and work 
			in related fields, the Standard Model of particle physics was derived. Following the discovery of a particle with properties 
			consistent with the Higgs boson at CERN in 2012, all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model, and no others, appear to 
			exist; however, physics beyond the Standard Model, with theories such as supersymmetry, is an active area of research. Areas of 
			mathematics in general are important to this field, such as the study of probabilities and groups.

	<h3>Subfields</h3>
	<div>
	<h5>Classical Mechanics</h5>
	<p>
		Classical mechanics is concerned with the set of physical laws describing the motion of bodies under the influence of a system of forces.
		 The study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one, making classical mechanics one of the oldest and largest subjects in science, 
		 engineering and technology. It is also known as Newtonian mechanics, though textbook authors often consider Newtonian mechanics as 
		 one of the three main formalisms of classical mechanics, along with Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics. Classical mechanics 
		 describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, as well as astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, 
		 planets, stars, and galaxies. Within classical mechanics are fields of study that describe the behavior of solids, liquids and gases and 
		 other specific sub-topics. Classical mechanics also provides extremely accurate results as long as the domain of study is restricted to 
		 large objects and the speeds involved do not approach the speed of light. When the objects being examined are sufficiently small, it becomes 
		 necessary to introduce the other major sub-field of mechanics, quantum mechanics, which adjusts the laws of physics of macroscopic objects 
		 for the atomic nature of matter by including the wave–particle duality of atoms and molecules. When both quantum mechanics and classical 
		 mechanics cannot apply, such as at the quantum level with high speeds, quantum field theory (QFT) becomes applicable.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Electrodynamics</h5>
	<p>
		Electromagnetism is a branch of physics involving the study of the electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between 
		electrically charged particles. The electromagnetic force usually exhibits electromagnetic fields such as electric fields, magnetic fields, 
		and light and is one of the four fundamental interactions (commonly called forces) in nature. The other three fundamental interactions are 
		the strong interaction, the weak interaction, and gravitation.
		
		The electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life. Ordinary matter
		 takes its form as a result of intermolecular forces between individual atoms and molecules in matter, and is a manifestation of the electromagnetic 
		 force. Electrons are bound by the electromagnetic force to atomic nuclei, and their orbital shapes and their influence on nearby atoms with their 
		 electrons is described by quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic force governs the processes involved in chemistry, which arise from interactions between 
		 the electrons of neighboring atoms.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Optics</h5>
	<p>
		Optics is the branch of physics which involves the behaviour and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the 
		construction of instruments that use or detect it. Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. 
		Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit 
		similar properties. Most optical phenomena can be accounted for using the classical electromagnetic description of light.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Acoustics</h5>
	<p>
		Acoustics is the interdisciplinary science that deals with the study of all mechanical waves in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as vibration, 
		sound, ultrasound and infrasound. A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of 
		acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer. The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society 
		with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Quantum Mechanics</h5>
	<p>
		Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory), including quantum field theory, is a branch of physics which is the 
		fundamental theory of nature at small scales and low energies of atoms and subatomic particles. Classical physics, the physics existing 
		before quantum mechanics, derives from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid only at large (macroscopic) scales. Quantum mechanics 
		differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum and other quantities are often restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects 
		have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be 
		known (Uncertainty principle). Quantum mechanics gradually arose from Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem 
		(reported 1859) and Albert Einstein's 1905 paper which offered a quantum-based theory to explain the photoelectric effect (reported 1887). 
		Early quantum theory was profoundly reconceived in the mid-1920s.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Relativity</h5>
	<p>
	The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity. Special 
	relativity applies to elementary particles and their interactions, describing all their physical phenomena except gravity. General relativity 
	explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature. It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including 
	astronomy.

	The theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, superseding a 200-year-old theory of mechanics created 
	primarily by Isaac Newton. It introduced concepts including spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, 
	kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary 
	particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age. With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics predicted 
	extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves.

	<h3>Impacts/Applications</h3>
	<div>
	<p>
		Applied physics is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular use. An applied physics curriculum usually 
		contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from engineering in that an 
		applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of 
		developing new technologies or solving a problem. The approach is similar to that of applied mathematics. Applied physicists use physics 
		in scientific research. For instance, people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in 
		theoretical physics.
	<p/>
    <p>
        Physics is used heavily in engineering. For example, statics, a subfield of mechanics, is used in the building of bridges and other static 
        structures. The understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of optics creates 
        better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators, video games, and movies, and is often 
        critical in forensic investigations.
    <p/>
    <p>
        With the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that 
        would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty. For example, in the study of the origin of the earth, one can reasonably model earth's mass, 
        temperature, and rate of rotation, as a function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward or backward in time and so predict future or 
        prior events. It also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology.

        But there is also considerable interdisciplinarity in the physicist's methods, so many other important fields are influenced by physics 
        (e.g., the fields of econophysics and sociophysics).
