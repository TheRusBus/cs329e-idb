	<h3>
	Overview
	</h3>
	<p>
	Charles Darwin, in full Charles Robert Darwin (born February 12,
1809, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England?died April 19, 1882,
Downe, Kent), English naturalist whose scientific theory of
<a href = "./theoryEvolution.html">evolution</a> by natural selection became the foundation of modern
evolutionary studies. An affable country gentleman, Darwin at
first shocked religious Victorian society by suggesting that
animals and humans shared a common ancestry. However, his
nonreligious <a href = "./fieldBiology.html">biology</a> appealed to the rising class of
professional scientists, and by the time of his death
evolutionary imagery had spread through all of science,
literature, and politics. Darwin, himself an agnostic, was
accorded the ultimate British accolade of burial in Westminster
Abbey, London.

	<h3>
	Relation to Evolution
	</h3>
<p>
The crucial break from the concept of constant typological
classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution
through natural selection, which was formulated by Charles
Darwin in terms of variable populations. Partly influenced by An
Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) by Thomas Robert
Malthus, Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a
"struggle for existence" in which favorable variations prevailed
as others perished. In each generation, many offspring fail to
survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources.
This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a
common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same
way for all types of organism.
</p>
<p>
At the end of 1859, Darwin's publication of his "abstract" as On
the Origin of Species explained natural selection in detail and
in a way that led to an increasingly wide acceptance of concepts
of evolution. Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to
humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide
strong evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry.
Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not
have a special place in the universe.
