	<h3>
	Overview
	</h3>
	<p>
	Galileo, in full Galileo Galilei (born February 15, 1564, Pisa
[Italy]?died January 8, 1642, Arcetri, near Florence), Italian
natural philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who made
fundamental contributions to the sciences of motion, astronomy,
and strength of materials and to the development of the
scientific method. His formulation of (circular) inertia, the
law of falling bodies, and parabolic trajectories marked the
beginning of a fundamental change in the study of motion. His
insistence that the book of nature was written in the language
of mathematics changed natural philosophy from a verbal,
qualitative account to a mathematical one in which
experimentation became a recognized method for discovering the
facts of nature. Finally, his discoveries with the telescope
revolutionized <a href="fieldAstronomy.html">astronomy</a> and paved the way for the acceptance of
the Copernican <a href="./theoryHelio.html">heliocentric system</a>, but his advocacy of that
system eventually resulted in an Inquisition process against him.

	Relation to Telescope
	</h3>
<p>
Galileo's career took a dramatic turn. In the spring of 1609 he
heard that in the Netherlands an instrument had been invented
that showed distant things as though they were nearby. By trial
and error, he quickly figured out the secret of the invention
and made his own three-powered spyglass from lenses for sale in
spectacle makers' shops. Others had done the same; what set
Galileo apart was that he quickly figured out how to improve the
instrument, taught himself the art of lens grinding, and
produced increasingly powerful telescopes. In August of that
year he presented an eight-powered instrument to the Venetian
Senate (Padua was in the Venetian Republic). He was rewarded
with life tenure and a doubling of his salary. Galileo was now
one of the highest-paid professors at the university. In the
fall of 1609 Galileo began observing the heavens with
instruments that magnified up to 20 times. In December he drew
the Moon's phases as seen through the telescope, showing that
the Moon's surface is not smooth, as had been thought, but is
rough and uneven. In January 1610 he discovered four moons
revolving around Jupiter. He also found that the telescope
showed many more stars than are visible with the naked eye.
These discoveries were earthshaking, and Galileo quickly
produced a little book, Sidereus Nuncius (The Sidereal
Messenger), in which he described them. He dedicated the book to
Cosimo II de Medici (1590?1621), the grand duke of his native
Tuscany, whom he had tutored in mathematics for several summers,
and he named the moons of Jupiter after the Medici family: the
Sidera Medicea, or Medicean Stars. Galileo was rewarded with
an appointment as mathematician and philosopher of the grand
duke of Tuscany, and in the fall of 1610 he returned in triumph
to his native land.
